Malaria and COVID-19 may have similar aspects and seem to have a strong 
potential for mutual influence. They have already caused millions of deaths, 
and the regions where malaria is endemic regions are at risk of suffering from 
the consequences of COVID-19 due to mutual side effects, such as less access 
to treatment for patients with malaria due to the fear of access to healthcare 
centers leading to worse outcomes and diagnostic delays. 
 Moreover, the similar and generic symptoms make it harder to achieve an 
immediate diagnosis. Healthcare systems and professionals will face a great 
challenge in case of a syndemic. Here, we present an overview of common and 
different findings for both diseases with possible mutual influences of one on 
the other, especially in countries with limited resources. The role of young 
health professionals, well-motivated and trained in primary care, will also be 
essential in countries with a high burden of malaria. In patients with symptoms 
such as fever, fatigue, and headache, both malaria and COVID-19 tests should 
always be performed. According to recent WHO recommendations , in the case 
of challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., supply chain disruption for 
RDTs, health worker absenteeism, shortage of personal protective equipment) 
a malaria diagnosis should be considered for all fever cases in endemic 
countries. On the other hand, patients with COVID-19-related symptoms that 
negative for malaria must undergo isolation to exclude COVID-19 until 
repetition of the virological sample, thus reducing the potential risk of 
transmission. Even though a COVID-19 outbreak may not occur in the malariaendemic regions, the WHO has called for ministries of health and national 
malaria control programs to ensure that malaria control efforts are not 
disrupted while facing the COVID-19 response . Preparedness is the key to 
tackling any public health crisis, and malaria-endemic countries need to be 
prepared for the challenges COVID-19 could pose. 
 The impact of the epidemic on the health financing system as a whole is 
considered. A polarization of economic resources happened with Ebola, and this 
is also being observed with COVID-19. Therefore, in the next month, it could 
be possible to observe an important decrease in economic and human 
resources for malaria control programs, with a real risk of reducing prevention. 
This is turn may result in an increase in the numbers of cases, with a 
consequent increase in morbidity and mortality. The characteristics of COVID19 and the previous experiences of the Ebola epidemic indicate the need for 
malaria-endemic countries to consider measures for preparation and 
prevention, focusing on not only the threat of COVID-19 but also the possible 
impact of other diseases, especially malaria [16]. In order to face these possible 
scenarios, COVID-19 preparedness and response in malaria-endemic countries 
should be focused on the following: 1. Local staff management, including 
protection, training, supervision, incentives, and rest shifts, should focus on all 
factors that together can help to ease the fear of contagion, diminish the anger 
over the death of colleagues, and contain strikes and protests; 2. Infection 
prevention and control measures should be applied for healthcare workers at 
the hospital and peripheral levels, making sure to institute appropriate lowtechnology measures such as washing hands with sodium hypochlorite, 
segregation of hospital waste, and proper application of the personal 
protective equipment; 3. Community engagement is crucial, as an effective 
communication campaign involving local leaders, indigenous associations, and 
media can compel the community to conform to the new behaviors (distancing, 
hand washing, stopping of traditional funeral rites, collaborating in contact 
tracing, etc.) and therefore in the end be able to retain trust in healthcare 
structures and operators; 4. Data management and operational research 
should not be neglected. It is of fundamental importance to monitor trends of 
routine health services use, maternal child health, TB, HIV, etc.
 Finally, from a global perspective, it is necessary to increase and join efforts 
in order to develop an effective vaccine and it make available for everyone, as 
this would be the most effective preventive measure for both disease
